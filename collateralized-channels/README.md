# collateralized-channels

Install [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) and run
```
go test -v perun.network/perun-collateralized-channels
```

The test starts a ganache-cli in the background. If the test does not shut down in order, make sure to kill the corresponding `node` process manually.
